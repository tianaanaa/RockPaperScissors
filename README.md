# RockPaperScissors
A python code to implement a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors


A python code that I have found similar to this game is https://github.com/effiongcharles/network_rock_paper_scissors_game

#On code2.py I added new functions to take two arguments, the user's action and the computers action.

#I will create a line of code to return an action of the argument.
